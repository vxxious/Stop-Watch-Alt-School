# ‚è± Stopwatch App

This is a simple **stopwatch web app** I built while learning **HTML, CSS, and JavaScript**.
It‚Äôs a small project, but it really helped me practice working with time, buttons, and adding some fun features.


## What it can do

* Start, stop, and reset the timer
* Record **lap times** while the stopwatch is running
* Show **milliseconds** for extra precision
* Switch between **dark mode and light mode** 
* Works on both **desktop and mobile**

## üõ† How it‚Äôs built

* **HTML** for the structure
* **CSS** for the styling (plus the dark/light theme)
* **JavaScript** for the stopwatch logic (time, laps, buttons)

## Project files

index.html   ‚Üí main page
style.css    ‚Üí styles and themes
script.js    ‚Üí stopwatch logic
README.md    ‚Üí this file



## How to use

1. Open the project in VS Code (or any editor).
2. Run `index.html` in your browser (Live Server is easiest).
3. Click:

   * **Start** ‚Üí to begin timing
   * **Stop** ‚Üí to pause
   * **Reset** ‚Üí to clear everything
   * **Lap** ‚Üí to save a lap time
   * **Toggle Theme** ‚Üí to switch between dark/light


Made this project as part of my JavaScript learning journey.
